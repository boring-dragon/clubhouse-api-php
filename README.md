----

This work is no way affiliated with Clubhouse. These files are the results of research into the Clubhouse on iOS.

## Installation

I strongly advice using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to keep updates as smooth as possible.

```sh
$ composer require boring-dragon/clubhouse-api
```

### Examples

All examples can be found [here](https://github.com/fadhiilrachman/clubhouse-api-php/tree/main/example).
